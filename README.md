# UT SGSC R Workshop 2025: Automating Research Output

Software: R, RStudio, SublimeText (recommended for a cleaner coding environment)

# Main packages: 

# Graphs  - 
ggplot2   (cheat sheet: https://statsandr.com/blog/files/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)

# Tables  - 
gtsummary (overview: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) 

flextable (cheat sheet: https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/static/pdf/cheat_sheet_flextable.pdf)

modelsummary (overview: https://modelsummary.com/articles/modelsummary.html)

Sample data: truncated HARP T1 Data

Sample codes are attached as well. 

Recommendation: Bring a small sample of data from the project you are working on. In this workshop, choose 3-5 variables with numeric, binary, and categorical variables to practice making tables and figures. If your data requires weighting, please also bring the weight variables (if it is incredibly complicated... I can't promise you a perfect result in the workshop, but at least something to start with). 

To ensure our practice runs as smoothly as possible, please try loading your sample data in R and properly label them, so they're table- and graph-ready (ex: Yes or No, instead of 1 and 0). You can take a look at Amanda's workshop materials for data-wrangling commands. 

I do hope to, however, help you with specific projects you are working on in preparation for RA work, class presentations, and eventual journal submission.
